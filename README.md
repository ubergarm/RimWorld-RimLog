RimLog
===
RimWorld mod loging out periodic time-series data for events, tales,
quests, chat and battle logs in CSV format into Desktop Folder
`rimlog.txt` file.

Compatible with [Interaction Bubbles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1516158345)

RimLog does *not* add speech bubbles, it logs those chats and more to
a file so you can look at it later outside the game.

[Example Log Output](https://gist.github.com/ubergarm/fbf7594524d96f824e6572d1ce7db517)

You can use this to AI Generate stories based on your actual colony names and events!
